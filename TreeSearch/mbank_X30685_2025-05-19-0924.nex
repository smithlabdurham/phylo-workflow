Daley and Edgecombe (2014) recently redescribed Anomalocaris canadensis and reported the presence of a smaller set of flaps in proximity with the putative head region; given that this differentiation is expressed in size, rather than structural identity, we score the deutocerebral limbs as undifferentiated in Anomalocaris.

The forward-facing stylet apparatus of Eutardigrada is internalized into the mouth cone (Halberg et al. 2009), and is thus considered as having a terminal position relative to the body; in Heterotardigrada, however, the mouth is oriented ventrally and the stylet apparatus is thus scored as having a ventral position.';

The differentiation observed in lobopodians (see below) is also reflected in the organisation of Louisella and Tylotites (Conway Morris 1977a; Han et al. 2007c; Zhang et al. 2015), where the anterior trunk has a different annulation pattern to the posterior portion, with an abrupt change separating the two regions. The “neck” of Eokinorhynchus is not consistently distinguishable from the introvert, and is considered to represent part of that structure.  The same is arguably true in Halicryptus higginsi, though not in H. spinulosus.  The anterior annulations of H. higginsi are much more closely spaced and bear denser setae than the posterior annulations (Shirley and Storch 1999), but in the absence of a sharp distinction between the regions this character is scored as ambiguous.  Coded absent in Cricocosmia (Hou et al. 2017); the diminution of annulations anteriad is reflected in a separate transformation series, and there is no clear morphological division of an anterior portion of the trunk.^nThis transformation series reflects the pronounced differentiation of the posterior and anterior trunk – not just the trunk appendages – in certain lobopodians.  In  Hallucigenia sparsa, the region of the trunk anterior of the third appendage pair is narrower, lacks dorsal armature, and expresses differentiated appendages (this study).  The short constricted region anterior of the first spine pair in H. fortis is associated with two differentiated appendage pairs (Ramsköld and Chen 1998) and apparently corresponds with the ‘neck’ of H. sparsa.  In luolishaniids, the anterior body bears elongate limbs with accentuated armature (Ma et al. 2009; García-Bellido et al. 2013).  The portion of the trunk in Carbotubulus corresponding to the first two or three leg pairs is substantially narrower than the posterior trunk and its associated appendages are narrower and less prominent than the posterior appendages, indicating trunk differentiation (Haug et al. 2012c).  Although the width of the trunk narrows gradually towards the front of Paucipodia, this tapering is gradual and does not correspond to the differentiation of the anterior trunk (Chen et al. 1995a; Hou et al. 2004).

They are thus treated as belonging to dorsal bands of sclerites.  They seem to be slightly offset from the central sclerites; hence this state is coded ambiguous to denote two sclerites if the lateral sclerites form separate bands, or three sclerites per row if the sclerites are lateral to the medial sclerite in a single band.';
