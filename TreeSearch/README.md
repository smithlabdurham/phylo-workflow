# TreeSearch analysis

Conduct phylogenetic analysis using the approximate correction for inapplicable
tokens proposed by Brazeau, Guillerme & Smith
([2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syy083))


## Install TreeSearch

- Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)

- Open R and type `install.packages("TreeSearch")` to download
  [TreeSearch](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/)


## Input data

- Copy the Nexus file containing character data into the `TreeSearch` folder
  - Ensure that the file has the ending `.nex`
  - If multiple `.nex` files are present, the file with the alphabetically
    latest name will be used.
    Because MorphoBank matrix downloads include a timestamp in their filename,
    this means that the latest such matrix will be used, as long as no other
    Nexus files are present.


## Run the analyses

### Point and click usage (Windows)

- (First time only) Right-click the shortcut `Analyze` and select "Properties".
  In `Target`, replace `C:\Program Files\AppJ\R\R-4.1.1\bin\x64\Rscript.exe` with
  the path `Rscript.exe` in your own `R` installation.
  Do the same for the `Visualize` shortcut.
  

- Double-click `analyze.lnk` to launch the analysis

- Once tree search is complete, double-click `visualize.lnk` to plot
  results to PDF.


### Interactive Usage

- Open the `TreeSearch.Rproj` project in [RStudio](https://posit.co/)

- Open `analyse.R` and, optionally, set the values of `searchRepeats`,
  `kValues`, and `timeout`

- In RStudio, select "Source → Source as Background job" and `Start` the script.

- Open `visualize.R` and set the value of `outgroup`

- Once tree search is complete, source `visualize.R`.


### Command-line usage

Alternatively, for potentially better performance, run the search at the
command line.

- Open `analyse.R` in your favourite
 [text editor](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) and check – if
  desired, modify – the values of `searchRepeats`, `kValues` and `timeout`

- Launch a command line terminal in the TreeSearch folder
  - Windows: Open the start menu and type "cmd" for "Command prompt", then type
    `cd ../` to navigate up the file directory, and `cd path` to enter a
    directory

- Run the script in R by typing `Rscript analyse.R`

- Once complete, visualize results by typing `Rscript visualize.R`


## What will happen

- TreeSearch will search for optimal trees under equal weights, then under
  equal weights using the concavity constants (`kValues`) in the order specified.

- Once each tree search is complete or times out, results will be written to
  a file named `<weighting>_<input_file_name>.trees`.

- For each `searchRepeats`, tree search will resume from the relevant `.trees`
  file.  Keep an eye on the output; once you are satisfied that tree score
  has reached an optimal value, you might consider tree search complete.

- `visualize.R` will take the latest output from the `.trees` file to plot
  a summary tree and a mapping of search progress in tree space to a like-named
  `.pdf` file.
  See [vignette](https://ms609.github.io/TreeSearch/articles/tree-search.html)
  for suggestions for interpreting the completeness of tree search.

## Customizing visualization

- The file `plot.R` allows colours to be specified for certain tips when
  plotted by `visualize.R`.  List the desired taxa against their colour names
  in the `TipCol()` function definition.
  
# Character visualization

A report listing character details and their reconstruction on an optimal tree
can be produced as a PDF, Word or HTML file using `Character_report.Rmd`.
Open that file in [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) for details.
The script assumes that the matrix is downloaded from MorphoBank in Nexus format
with character notes.

Bibliographic references can be included and generated by the character report.
To do so, add bibliographic references in bibtex format to `REFERENCES.bib`, and
link them in character descriptions using the `@ReferenceKey` format.
